    <h3>Butter Chicken</h3>
    <p> butter chicken also called Murgh Makhani and it hails from Northern India. It’s quite a mild curry compared to many Indian curries, and outside of India, it’s become just about everybody’s favourite curry!</p>

    <p>As much as I love making Indian food at home, sometimes I find the list of ingredients daunting. It’s easy enough to make once I gather all the ingredients, but that’s where I usually fall short because it requires a trip to an Indian grocery store – and my closest one is a fair drive away.</p>

    <h1>ingredients</h1>

        <li>chicken thighs</li>
